<h1>Project Title:-</h1>
This is an Atificial Neural Network Image Classifier built with convNet using keras</br>
<h1>Description:-</h1>
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image<br/> 
assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image<br/> 
and be able to differentiate one from the other.<br/>
<h1>Libraries Used:-</h1>
1)Pandas</br>
2)Matplotlib</br>
3)keras</br>
4)Scikit-Learn
